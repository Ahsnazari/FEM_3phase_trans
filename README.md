In this project a 3phase transformator is analyzed utilizing Ansys Maxwell software's FEA.
This is a simple project for learning AnSYS and FEA's basics. A 3phase, stacked steel transformer is modelled. 
First we build a 2d model of a 3phase trans:

This is the B distribution in the model following one half cycle and at the end of simulation (5 cycles).

And the flux distribution:

In the next step we will optimize our design using the results from previous step.
