# FEM_3phase_trans
In this project a 3phase transformator is analyzed utilizing Ansys Maxwell software's FEA.
This is a simple project for learning AnSYS and FEA's basics. A 3phase, stacked steel transformer is modelled. 
First we build a 3d model of a 3phase trans:

Then, after assigning materials to the coils and cores, we will begin the FEM modelling. The change of magnetic field distribution in different timesteps:

The stranded loss and calculated inductance of phase A (high voltage side)

In the next step we will optimize our design using the results from previous step.
